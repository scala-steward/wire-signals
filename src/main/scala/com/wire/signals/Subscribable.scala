/** `Subscribable` is a trait implemented by event streams and signals to define how should they react to that
  * a subscription to them is created.
  **
  * I think the easiest way to explain how `Subscribable` works will be with an example.
  * Let's say we create an event stream of ints:
  *
  * `val stream = EventStream[Int]`
  *
  * This line will create a `SourceStream[Int]` which is a subclass of `EventStream[Int]` which in turn implements
  * `EventSource[Int]` and `Subscribable[EventSubscriber[Int]]`. The `Subscribable` trait can have any type as its
  * parameter, the only restriction being that the class which implements `Subscribable` should know how to notify
  * "source subscribers" of this type when a new event comes (`Subscribable` doesn't care what method will be used
  * to do it). In this case, the "source subscriber" is `EventSubscriber`.
  *
  * Please not that [[SourceSubscriber]] is a trait or a class type. This is different from another generic type called
  * [[Subscription.Subscriber]] which is a function type used to create a [[Subscription]]. We will get to it in a second.
  *
  * So far, there are no event subscribers yet, which means that if we publish anything to this stream, nothing will happen.
  * What we need is to subscribe to it with, for example:
  *
  * `stream { number => ... }`
  *
  * A few things happen here. `{ number => ... }` is a function of the type `Int => Unit`, a.k.a `Subscription.Subscriber[Int]`.
  * It is used to create a subscription to the stream, together with two other arguments, which here get default values:
  * 1. [[EventContext]] - here the global event context is used.
  * 2. An option of [[scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext]] - here `None` is used, indicating that the subscriber function
  *    will always be executed in the execution context in which the event was published (no execution context switching).
  * If we wanted to specify the execution context, not leave out the event context, and not ignore the result subscription,
  * that line would look like this:
  * `val sub: Subscription = stream.on(executionContext){ number => ... }(EventContext.Global)`
  * Just after the subscription is created by the `apply` or `on` method, it is being enabled. And if the specified event
  * context is started (the global event context always is), this in turn calls `Subscription.subscribe` in the subscription
  * subclass instance created by the event stream. And that in turn calls `Subscribable.subscribe` for the event stream.
  *
  * Then, since this is the first subscription created, `Subscribable.subscribe` will call `EventStream.onWire`.
  *
  * The number of jumps between methods is quite big and it raises the question if we actually need all this flexibility.
  * If not, I hope this description will help us in simplifying this chain of function calls.
